# HTRU2-Pulsar-Detection
Project relative to the analysis of the HTRU2 dataset through the use of Machine Learning algorithms.
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at Politecnico di Torino, A.Y. 2021/2022

## Content of the repository
* [report.pdf](report.pdf) is the report showing the results and the choices made during the model analysis.
* [main.py](main.py) is the main that must be executed in order to obtain the results shown in the report.
* [func_lib](func_lib) is a folder containing a collection of Machine Learning algorithms and auxiliary libraries.
* [project_plots](project_plots) is a folder containing all the plots generated by the execution of [main.py](main.py).

## Known issues in [main.py](main.py) (as highlighted by the professor)
* wrong application of the score calibration in both evaluation phase and validation phase
* other minor issues that I can't recall
* missing hyperparameter analysis during evaluation (also in the report)

No ML libraries or ML toolboxes have been used in this project.
